## Quick Sort

Quick Sort selects a “pivot” element and partitions the array so that all elements smaller than the pivot are on one side, and all larger elements are on the other. It then recursively sorts the subarrays.

#### Approach

- Make the right-most index value pivot
- partition the array using pivot value
- quicksort left partition recursively
- quicksort right partition recursively

```java
public class QuickSort {
    public static void quickSort(int[] array, int low, int high) {
        if (low < high) {
            int pivotIndex = partition(array, low, high);
            quickSort(array, low, pivotIndex - 1);
            quickSort(array, pivotIndex + 1, high);
        }
    }

private static int partition(int[] array, int low, int high) {
        int pivot = array[high];
        int i = low - 1;
        for (int j = low; j < high; j++) {
            if (array[j] < pivot) {
                i++;
                int temp = array[i];
                array[i] = array[j];
                array[j] = temp;
            }
        }
        int temp = array[i + 1];
        array[i + 1] = array[high];
        array[high] = temp;
        return i + 1;
    }
}
```

### Complexity

- Best/Average case: O(n log ⁡n)
- Worst case: O(n²)(poor pivot choice)
- Space complexity: O(log⁡ n) (recursion stack)

#### Example

```
arr[] = {10, 80, 30, 90, 40, 50, 70}
Indexes:  0   1   2   3   4   5   6

low = 0, high =  6, pivot = arr[h] = 70
Initialize index of smaller element, i = -1

Traverse elements from j = low to high-1
j = 0 : Since arr[j] <= pivot, do i++ and swap(arr[i], arr[j])
i = 0
arr[] = {10, 80, 30, 90, 40, 50, 70} // No change as i and j
                                     // are same

j = 1 : Since arr[j] > pivot, do nothing
// No change in i and arr[]

j = 2 : Since arr[j] <= pivot, do i++ and swap(arr[i], arr[j])
i = 1
arr[] = {10, 30, 80, 90, 40, 50, 70} // We swap 80 and 30

j = 3 : Since arr[j] > pivot, do nothing
// No change in i and arr[]

j = 4 : Since arr[j] <= pivot, do i++ and swap(arr[i], arr[j])
i = 2
arr[] = {10, 30, 40, 90, 80, 50, 70} // 80 and 40 Swapped
j = 5 : Since arr[j] <= pivot, do i++ and swap arr[i] with arr[j]
i = 3
arr[] = {10, 30, 40, 50, 80, 90, 70} // 90 and 50 Swapped

We come out of loop because j is now equal to high-1.
Finally we place pivot at correct position by swapping
arr[i+1] and arr[high] (or pivot)
arr[] = {10, 30, 40, 50, 70, 90, 80} // 80 and 70 Swapped

Now 70 is at its correct place. All elements smaller than
70 are before it and all elements greater than 70 are after
it.
