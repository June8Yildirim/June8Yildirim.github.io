      - title: Habit Management
        content: Designed a versatile habit-tracking engine supporting six distinct data types (Boolean, Numeric, Duration, Checklist, Streak, Periodic) to accommodate diverse user goals and measurable behavioral changes. Integrated a sophisticated mood-correlation system featuring 20 distinct emotional states, allowing users to visualize the relationship between mental well-being and habit consistency through interactive charts. Implemented an advanced visual analytics dashboard using the Swift Charts framework, providing users with heatmaps, trend lines, and completion rate statistics across weekly, monthly, and yearly intervals. Leveraged SwiftData and CloudKit to build a modern, reactive persistence layer that automates data synchronization while maintaining a zero-latency, offline-first user experience.
